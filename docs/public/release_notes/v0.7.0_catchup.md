# Release Notes: Phase 8 Completion (D-80 to D-107)

**Version**: v0.7.0
**Release Date**: 2026-02-15
**Focus**: The Sovereign Nervous System

---

## Overview

This release marks the transition from a passive trading engine to a **Sovereign Nervous System**. The system now possesses self-awareness of its own latency (Vitality), the ability to hot-swap its consciousness (Handoff), and a hierarchical command structure that allows for manual intervention without breaking the OODA loop (Authority Bridge).

**Security Notice**: Specific algorithmic logic, parameter sets, and alpha generation models are excluded from this documentation.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities Delivered

### 1. The Vitality Sentinel (D-80)

- **Objective**: Ensure the system operates within strict latency budgets ("The 20µs Rule").
- **Mechanism**: The `Sentinel` component monitors the jitter and latency of every OODA tick.
- **Outcome**: If system jitter exceeds safety thresholds, the engine automatically degrades to a "Cool-down" mode or halts completely to prevent execution on stale data.

### 2. The Authority Bridge (D-86)

- **Objective**: Allow the Operator (Pilot) to intervene safely during live operations.
- **Mechanism**: A dedicated gRPC channel (`InjectSovereignCommand`) that bypasses the standard decision loop.
- **Commands**:
  - `VETO`: Immediately suspend the "Act" phase.
  - `KILL`: Execute the Omega Protocol (Emergency Shutdown).
  - `CLOSE_ALL`: Flatten all positions via the Order Gateway.
  - `SET_SENTIMENT`: Manually override the semantic bias.

### 3. The Ignition Sequence (D-83)

- **Objective**: Prevent startup in an unstable environment.
- **Mechanism**: The `GenesisOrchestrator` performs a rigorous pre-flight check before the first market tick is processed.
- **Checks**:
  - Connectivity to Exchange (Kraken/Binance).
  - Database Integrity (QuestDB/Postgres).
  - Telemetry Pipeline Health.
  - Latency Baseline Verification.

### 4. The Fiscal Control Deck (D-105) & Legislation (D-107)

- **Objective**: Granular control over capital allocation and strategic bias.
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Fiscal Deck**: Real-time snapshot of Equity, PnL, and Exposure exposed via gRPC.
  - **Legislator**: Dynamic configuration of "Strategic Bias" (e.g., `LONG_ONLY`, `NEUTRAL`) and "Aggression" scaling.
  - **Impact**: Allows the system to adapt to changing market regimes (e.g., "Hibernation Mode" during high volatility) without code deploys.

### 5. Hot-Swap Protocol (D-81)

- **Objective**: Zero-downtime upgrades.
- **Mechanism**: Use of Shared Memory to transfer state (Sequence IDs, Risk Limits) between the dying process and the rising process.
- **Status**: Currently implemented in `SHADOW MODE` for verification.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Updates

- **Reflex Service (gRPC)**: Updated to include `GetTickHistory` (D-106) and `UpdateLegislation` (D-107) endpoints.
- **OODA Core**: Now accepts `LegislativeState` to bias decisions based on external "Law".
- **Rebalancer (D-90)**: A recursive feedback loop that adjusts risk limits based on "System Fidelity" (a composite metric of uptime, latency consistency, and decision quality).

### Safety Protocols

- **Omega Protocol**: A hard-coded kill switch that wipes authentication keys and terminates the process if `System Sanity < Critical Threshold`.
- **Origin Guard**: Enforces that `SIM` mode cannot connect to `LIVE` execution venues, and vice-versa.

## ✅ Verification Status

- **D-80 (Sentinel)**: Latency metrics visible in Telemetry.
- **D-83 (Ignition)**: System successfully aborts startup if dependencies are missing.
- **D-86 (Authority)**: `VETO` command verified to suspend execution.
- **D-107 (Legislation)**: Strategic bias updates reflected in OODA state.

**System Status**: `[OPERATIONAL - LEVEL 1]`
